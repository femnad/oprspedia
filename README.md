Opressipedia!
=============

Opressipedia! (or *oprspedia* among friends) is a lazy method of circumventing government censorship.

What Works?
-----------

Almost nothing! But if you're living in Opressia and Wikipedia is censored, you have nothing to lose, and being too lazy for sane solutions you could change the `wiki` part of an English Wikipedia article URL to `oprs`:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty -> https://en.oprspedia.org/wiki/Liberty

And behold; a pinch of freedom in its pre-css glory!

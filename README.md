Opressipedia!
=============

Opressipedia! (or *oprspedia* among friends) is a lazy method of circumventing government censorship. Specifically, if you're living somewhere where Wikipedia (yes, **that** Wikipedia) is blocked you could use oprspedia instead of more saner methods.

Saner Methods
-------------

* VPN and proxy services
* If you have a vps you could go with a SOCKS proxy or something like [https://github.com/apenwarr/sshuttle](sshuttle)
* IPFS: https://ipfs.io/blog/24-uncensorable-wikipedia/
* Overthrow governments which routinely conduct oppressive acts
* Also probably many others I'm not aware of

How?
----
Change the `wiki` part of an English Wikipedia article URL to `oprs`:

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty -> https://en.oprspedia.org/wiki/Liberty

What Doesn't Work
-----------

* Non-English wikipedia pages
* User functionality (this is intentional, since that would be too unsecure)
* Responsive pages on mobile devices (worked on this for a while to no success)
